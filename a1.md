##How the data structures worked
I created a board read from one of the test files included in the assignment. Upon entering the solveBoard method, there are a number of catch cases that assist in completing recursive calls. The first of which being if the current position in the column is greater than board length, the next being if the board is solved fully, and the last being if we encounter something other than a +. The program proceeds by checking all the letters after a current letter and further checking if there are any matches in the dictionary. If there is a probable solution the board continues. However, if we encounter a word the program created that creates conflict in the previous words, the current position climbs up the board returning plus signs to where the letter once was. This clears the board up until our previous letter that the program was examining, and proceeds only this time starting with a different letter at our current position. The program repeats this process. Going up and across the board until all posible solutions are achieved.


##Compliation of run-times
Test3a.txt = 195780300
Test3b.txt = 332968900
Test4b.txt = 5824145700
Test4f.txt = 846040100
Test5a.txt = 5006420800
Test8c.txt = 935635935300


##How the algorithm proceeded
Generally speaking the data structure works by checking all of the letters tangent to the current position. After this the program uses search prefix to check if our current built string is a valid prefix in the dictionary, if it is a valid word, or if it is both a valid word and prefix. If true, the program falls through the rest of the if statements, else the program climbs back up and tries a previous letter and the process repeats.
##Coding and debugging issues faced
I had some organizational issues at first in regards to recursion. I had a hard time thinking of possible base and edge cases which made it hard to progress in the program. To solve this problem I looked back at the boggle solution to give me some ideas on how to progress. This refreshed my understanding of the boggle game and how it went about checking the letters adjacent to its position. Additionally, my program was creating odd results that only had one word or a half a word as a printed result. To understand more about the problem I placed some prints of my stringBuilder variables responsible for holding words or prefixes before I started searching for them. I discovered my traversal through the board using the column instead of a row was causing my program some problems. 
##Asymptotic analysis of the worst case run time of the program
For the asymptotic analysis where w is how many words are in the dictionary, and k is the average number of characters in a word. It is big O(w*k) for search prefix. Let n is the length for the board, we have n^2 positions to fill. We know there are 26 letters in the english alphabet and for each letter we fill in a given space, we potentially have to check for all other spaces. Therefore, we will have 26^(n^2) recursive calls where each call takes approximately O(w*k) time. So, O(26^(n^2)*w*k). Where w is the number of words in the dictionary, and n is the size of the board, and k being the average size of a word.
